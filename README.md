# Coursera_Capstone

The IBM Data Science Capstone course consists of choosing a self-directed project that displays the skills learned through the coursework.

This project analyzes real estate auction data and attempts to model winning bids for an upcoming auction.

This repository contains three main files: 
  
  1. a Jupyter notebook written in Python showing the details of the analysis
  
  2. a pdf report describing the whole analysis,
  
  3. and a slide deck that can be used to present this analysis to real estate investors.
